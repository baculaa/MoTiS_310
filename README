MoTiS Parameters:
- Relative Speed
- Relative Start Time
- Relative Direction
- Proximity (Relative Spacing)
- Geometry
- Coherence


 MoTiS includes six parameters that are adapted to multi-robot systems and take into consideration the challenges of a multi-robot domain. In particular, this framework seeks to extend and coalesce prior concepts from single and multi-robot expressive motion, such as proximity and speed, and also introduces the concept of relativity, i.e., a temporal sequence, movement relative to another agent, or the floor plan of a space.
